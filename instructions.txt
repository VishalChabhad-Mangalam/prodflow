I have updated the Vite configuration to resolve the PostCSS issue. This should fix the error you were seeing.

I recommend you delete the now redundant `postcss.config.js` and `postcss.config.mjs` files.

Please run `npm run dev` in the `c:\prodflow\frontend` directory to start the development server and see if the issue is resolved.
